	                <p>Because Dell Software respects its customers and understands that you are concerned about privacy, we have instituted policies and security measures intended to ensure that your personal information is handled in a safe and responsible manner. We also post this privacy policy so that you can agree to the kind of information we collect, how it is handled, and with whom it may be shared.

	                        <p>When you engage in certain activities on this site, such as ordering products, downloading software, obtaining technical support or entering contests, Dell Software may ask you to provide certain information about yourself by filling out and submitting an online form. It is completely optional for you to engage in these activities. If you elect to engage in these activities, however, Dell Software may require that you provide us with personal information, such as your name, title, company, mailing or billing or shipping address, work e-mail address, work phone number and other personal identifying information. When ordering products on the site, you may be asked to provide credit card information.</p>
	                        <p>If you choose to use our referral service to tell a friend about our site, we will ask you for your friend's name and email address. We will automatically send your friend a one-time email inviting him or her to visit the site. Dell Software does not store this information. </p>

	                    <li><span>Use of Personal Information</span>
	                        <p>When you submit personal information to Dell Software, you understand and agree that Dell Software, its subsidiaries and affiliates may transfer, store, and process your customer profile in any of the countries in which Dell Software and its affiliates maintain offices, including without limitation, the United States. Dell Software abides by the safe harbor framework as set forth by the U.S. Department of Commerce regarding the collection, use and retention of data from the European Union.</p>
	                        <p>Dell Software, its affiliates and subsidiaries collect this information in order to record and support your participation in the activities you select and to provide the products and services on the website. If you order a product, for example, the information is used to register your license and rights, if any, to technical support, upgrade discounts, or other benefits that may be made available to registered users. You agree that Dell, its affiliates and subsidiaries can store and use your information for these purposes, including, if applicable, transferring your data to our third party payment processors. Dell, its affiliates and subsidiaries use third party address verification software to verify the address provided is a correct mailing address. If you enter a contest, information is collected to qualify the entry and contact you regarding the contest or prize awards. Dell, its affiliates and subsidiaries also use information that you provide as part of our effort to send you information about product upgrades, special offers, and other Dell products and services.</p>
	                        <p>Dell Software recognizes and appreciates the importance of responsible use of this information. If you do not want the information you provide to Dell Software to be used to inform you of other products and special offers, or if you wish to change or modify information previously provided, you can do so by following the procedures set forth in the <a href="http://www.quest.com/legal/privacy.aspx#choice" target="_blank">Choice/Opt-Out or Correct/Update</a> Section of this policy. We do not sell your personal information to third parties unless we obtain your prior consent. We may, however, share your information with a distributor or partner in your area who can assist with your request for information if Dell does not have its own sales force your area. The distributor or partner may use these details to contact you about the support services that they may offer as well as other Dell products or services that you may be interested in. If you do not want to receive information from our distributors or partners, you may opt out by following the procedures set forth in the <a href="http://www.quest.com/legal/privacy.aspx#choice" target="_blank">Choice/Opt-Out or Correct/Update</a> Section of this policy.</p>

	                        <p>We use this information, which does not identify individual users, to analyze trends, to administer the site, to track users' movements around the site and to gather demographic information about our user base as a whole. We do not link this automatically-collected data to personally identifiable information.</p>
	                        <p>We use a third-party tracking service that uses tracking technologies to track non-personally identifiable information about visitors to our site in the aggregate to capture usage and volume statistics.</p>

	                        <p>While Dell Software uses cookies to track your visit to the Dell Software Web site, this information does not identify you personally and you remain anonymous unless you have otherwise provided Dell Software with personal information.</p>
